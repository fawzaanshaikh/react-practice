- You create a new app by typing in 'npx create-react-app app-name'
- npx borrows the modules for a while, whereas npm downloads them forever
- You make changes in App.js which shows the changes in the entire application
- App.js uses JSX, which is a form of JS wherein we write code in HTML but with JS' standards
- You can return only one element in a JSX return function
   eg. return(<div> .. </div>);
- Multiple elements can be returned using a JSX fragment
   eg. <>
	<h1> .. </h1>
	<div> .. </div>
       </>

- Webpack is used to change the CSS files through JSX/ JS
- Babel compiles JSX code into JS (React.createElement() calls)
